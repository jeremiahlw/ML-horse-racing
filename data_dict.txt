Can you beat the market?
Horse racing has always intrigued me - not so much from the point of view as a sport, but more from the view of it as a money market. Inspired by the pioneers of computerised horse betting, I'm sharing this dataset in the hope of finding more data scientists willing to take up the challenge and find new ways of exploiting it!

As always, the goal for most of us is to find information in the data that can be used to generate profit, usually by finding information that has not already been considered by the other players in the game. But I'm always interested in finding new uses for the data, whatever they may be.

Horse racing is a huge business in Hong Kong, which has **two race tracks in a city that is only 1,104 square km. The **betting pools are bigger than all US racetracks combined, which means that the opportunity is unlimited for those who are successful.

So are you up for it?

Content
The data was obtained from various free sources and is presented in CSV format. Personally-identifiable information, such as horse and jockey names, has not been included. However these should have no relevance to the purpose of this dataset, which is purely for experimental use.

#jw.resource -- https://www.horseracinginfo.com.au/race-tracks/happy-valley-racecourse.php

There are two files:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (1)

races.csv
Each line describes the condition of an individual race.

race_id - unique identifier for the race

date - date of the race, in YYYY-MM-DD format (note that the dates given have been obscured and are not the real ones, although the durations between each race should be correct)

venue - a 2-character string, representing which of the 2 race courses this race took place at: ST = Shatin, HV = Happy Valley
#prob want to filter by race course before/while doing EDA?

race_no - race number of the race in the day's meeting

config - race track configuration, mostly related to the position of the inside rail. For more details, see the HKJC website.

#Happy Valley Track Details
The tight, right-handed city race track has a circumference of 1450m metres with five distances being utilised - 1000m, 1200m, 1650m, 1800m and 2200m. The track uses four courses A B C and C+3 ith the A course being the widest and the rail moving outwards.

#General speaking, those horses nearer the rail have an edge in comparison to those running two or three wide. Comparatively, the A course is the fairest and least prone to any bias. If anything, the C+3 tends to be predisposed to producing more on-pace, on-the-rails results.

surface - a number representing the type of race track surface: 1 = dirt, 0 = turf
#def an important feature

distance - distance of the race, in metres
#def an important feature

going - track condition. For more details, see the HKJC website.

Acknowledgements
None of this research would have even started without me standing on the shoulders of giants such as William Benter, Ruth Bolton and Randall Chapman and many others who have published the results of their research.

Inspiration
It is probably not going to be enough to just take this dataset and feed it into Google Cloud Machine Learning, Azure MI, etcâ€¦ but let me know if you find otherwise!

Questions that need to be answered include:

Feature engineering - what features are needed and how best to estimate them from the data given?
Modelling - what kind of model works best? Maybe more than one model?
Other data - is there any other data needed, apart from that given in this data set?
